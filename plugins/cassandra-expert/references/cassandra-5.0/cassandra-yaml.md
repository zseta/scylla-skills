# Cassandra 5.0 cassandra.yaml Recommendations

## Quick Start: cassandra_latest.yaml

Cassandra 5.0 ships with `cassandra_latest.yaml` - a new config file with optimized defaults for new clusters.  This is a good reference to see the settings that enabled the newest features, all of which are opt-in.

## Critical Settings

### num_tokens

```yaml
num_tokens: 1  # or 4
```

**Use 1 token when possible, never more than 4.**

- More tokens = more data movement during scaling
- More tokens = more overhead in token calculations
- More tokens = worse Zero-Copy Streaming eligibility

For detailed explanation of why vnode count matters and the math behind neighbor calculations, see `../general/vnodes.md`.

### Storage Compatibility Mode

```yaml
storage_compatibility_mode: NONE
```

Set to `NONE` to enable all 5.0 features including:
- BTI SSTable format
- Extended TTL (dates beyond 2038)
- UUID-based SSTable generation

### Memtable Configuration

Trie memtables 

```yaml
memtable:
  configurations:
    skiplist:
      class_name: SkipListMemtable
    trie:
      class_name: TrieMemtable
    default:
      inherits: trie

memtable_allocation_type: offheap_objects
memtable_heap_space: 4GiB
memtable_offheap_space: 8GiB

```

**Use trie memtables with off-heap allocation.**

- Reduces GC pressure significantly
- Better write performance
- Off-heap keeps data out of the Java heap
- The `default: inherits: trie` applies trie memtables to all tables

### Key Cache

```yaml
key_cache_size: 0
```

With BTI format, key cache provides no benefit. The trie-based index is efficient enough without caching.

Only keep key cache enabled if you have legacy BIG format SSTables.

### Compaction Throughput

Cassandra 5.0.4+ includes significant compaction throughput improvements (CASSANDRA-15452):
- 2-3x improvement in throughput
- 3x reduction in IOPS on cloud storage
- Uses efficient 256KB off-heap read buffer

```yaml
compaction_throughput: 64MiB/s  # or higher
```

**Upgrade to at least 5.0.4+ for these benefits.**

### Default Compaction Strategy

```yaml
default_compaction:
  class_name: UnifiedCompactionStrategy
  parameters:
    scaling_parameters: T4
    max_sstables_to_compact: 64
    target_sstable_size: 1GiB
    sstable_growth: 0.3333333333333333
    min_sstable_size: 100MiB
```

Sets UCS as the default for all new tables. The `T4` scaling parameter emulates STCS behavior while maintaining bounded SSTable sizes.

### Concurrent Compactors

```yaml
concurrent_compactors: 8
```

Enables parallel compaction operations. Adjust based on available CPU cores and I/O capacity.

## Compression Settings

```yaml
# Default compression for new tables
compression:
  class: ZstdCompressor
  chunk_length_in_kb: 16
```

**Avoid the legacy 64KB chunk size.**

- Larger chunks = more data decoded per read
- 16KB is a good balance for most workloads
- Consider 4KB for counter tables (read-before-write pattern) and tables using LWT to minimize the overhead of decompression on single row reads.  

## Commitlog Settings

The default here hasn't kept up with modern hardware.  Use 1 second sync period to minimize the data loss window.

```yaml
commitlog_sync_period: 1s
commitlog_disk_access_mode: auto
```

- `commitlog_sync_period`: 10s is outdated. 1s reduces data loss window on modern hardware.
- `commitlog_disk_access_mode`: `auto` selects optimal mode based on hardware.

### Trickle Fsync

```yaml
trickle_fsync: true
trickle_fsync_interval: 10MiB
```

Avoids sudden large I/O bursts by syncing incrementally.

## Streaming Settings

```yaml
stream_entire_sstables: true
```

Enables Zero-Copy Streaming. This is the default but verify it's enabled.

**Note**: Automatically disabled with internode encryption.

## Thread Pool Settings

```yaml
concurrent_reads: 64
concurrent_writes: 256
```

Defaults are often reasonable, but monitor for saturation:
- Increase if threads are consistently saturated with low CPU usage
- Watch for blocked threads in `nodetool tpstats`

## Cache Settings

```yaml
row_cache_size: 0
```

**Keep row cache disabled.** It's rarely beneficial and often harmful:
- High memory overhead
- Cache invalidation overhead
- Better to rely on OS page cache


## Guardrails

Cassandra 5.0 adds guardrails to prevent problematic configurations:

```yaml
# Example guardrails
tables_warn_threshold: 150
tables_fail_threshold: 200
columns_per_table_warn_threshold: 25
columns_per_table_fail_threshold: 50
```

Review and tune guardrails based on your operational requirements.

## Settings to Avoid

### Row Cache

Never enable `row_cache_size` unless you have a very specific, validated use case.  I haven't found any.

### Auto Bootstrap False

Don't set `auto_bootstrap: false` unless you know exactly what you're doing (e.g., restoring from backup).

### Large num_tokens

Never use `num_tokens` > 4. The historical default of 256 is harmful.

### Materialized Views

Keep them disabled.  Materized views are a half baked feature that should never have been merged in.

```
materialized_views_enabled: false
```

# Compaction

```yaml
default_compaction:
  class_name: UnifiedCompactionStrategy
  parameters:
    scaling_parameters: T4
    max_sstables_to_compact: 64
    target_sstable_size: 1GiB
    sstable_growth: 0.3333333333333333
    min_sstable_size: 100MiB
```

## Migration Notes

When upgrading from Cassandra 4.x:

1. **Don't change storage_compatibility_mode immediately** - wait until all nodes are upgraded
2. **Key cache**: Keep enabled until all SSTables are rewritten to BTI format
3. **num_tokens**: Cannot be changed on existing clusters without full rebuild
4. **Memtable settings**: Can be changed with rolling restart
